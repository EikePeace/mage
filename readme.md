## Issues / bugs

Before you create a new issue, take a look at the [List of things already fixed but not yet released](https://github.com/magefree/mage/wiki/Features-and-fixes-not-released-yet#features-and-fixes-not-released-yet) to avoid creating uneccessary new issues.
Also there is always a bug thread in the [Official XMage forum](http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=70) which we check regularly.

## Installation

* Download [latest XMage launcher file](http://xmage.de) and put it to any folder like `D:\games\xmage`;
* You need to have [Java version 8 or later](http://java.com/) to run it;
* If you can't run it then create `run-LAUNCHER.cmd` text file in launcher folder and put that line to it and save as ANSI format:
  * `java -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -jar XMageLauncher-0.3.8.jar` 

Look [here](http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=70&t=13632) for more detailed instructions.

## Performance tweaks

If you have a good GPU, it's very likely you'll be able increase performance by **a lot** through extra Java flags.

XMage runs on JRE 8, so [this link](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/2d/flags.html) should give you the available flags.

### How to enable the extra flags

1. Launch XMage
2. In the menu bar from the launcher, click on "Settings", which will open up the Settings Window
3. Go to the "Java" tab
4. You can pass extra flags by editing the "Client java options" text field

### Linux guide

#### Enable OpenGL

[Link](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/2d/flags.html#opengl)

`-Dsun.java2d.opengl=true`

_**Caveat**_: [There's a bug](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-6545140) with the file chooser when OpenGL is enabled (you use the file chooser when you, for instance, try to load a deck from disk). The [suggested workaround](https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6439320) will make the game crash, so it's not an option.

_**Workaround**_: When using [i3](https://github.com/i3/i3), you're able to work around the bug by toggling the "floating" capabilities of the window and forcing it to re-render.

#### Enable XRender

[Link](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/2d/flags.html#xrender)

`-Dsun.java2d.xrender=true`

#### Bigger upfront heap size

[SO explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57839720/8401696)

This is not guaranteed to yield improvements, but it depends on your use-case. If you have a lot of RAM to spare, you might as well increase the initial heap size for good measure.

`-Xms1G -Xmx2G`
